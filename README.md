The default forecast panel on Mountain Project was often showing up as unavailable. This extension makes the forecast show up more reliably for all area pages, including internationally.

## Installation

Add the extension to your Chrome browser from the [extension page](TODO) or by cloning/downloading this repository and [adding it manually](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked).
