# ![icon](media/icon-32.png) Mountain Project Weather Enhanced

Chrome extension that replaces the weather forecast panel on Mountain Project (MP) area pages for more coverage, detail, and reliability.

The default forecast panel on MP does not work for any areas under the "International" area umbrella. Additionally, even for supported areas in the United States, the forecast would often show up as unavailable. This extension uses the FOSS [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) API instead, which allows for global forecasting and may increase reliability even in areas that were already covered by MP.

The daily forecasts also offer on-click expanision into an hourly forecast with the forecast statistics that are often considered when planning to climb.
